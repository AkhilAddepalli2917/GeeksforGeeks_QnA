**Author:** Akhil Addepalli  
**Date:** November 7, 2024

## Repository Overview

**GeeksforGeeks_QnA** is a collection of data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions and answers based on the "DSA in Python - Self Paced" course from GeeksforGeeks. The aim of this repository is to organize and consolidate DSA problems with their solutions in Python, making it easier for students and developers to study and reference them in one place.

## Folder Descriptions

The repository is organized into the following categories:

- **Basic:** Contains fundamental array operations like insertion, retrieval, and finding minimum/maximum values.
- **Easy:** Contains beginner-friendly DSA problems, including counting, searching, and basic manipulation techniques.
- **Medium:** Contains moderately challenging problems that require more in-depth understanding of arrays and algorithms.
- **And other subsequent difficulty levels from GeeksforGeeks**

Each file within these folders contains:

- **Problem Statement:** Description of the problem to solve.
- **Solution:** Python code for the solution.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by Topic:** Go to the specific topic or folder level (e.g., Lists > Easy) to find questions related to that topic.
2. **Read and Understand:** Each file is named according to the question it contains. Open the file to view the question, solution, and explanation.
3. **Practice and Improve:** Use this repository as a reference while practicing DSA problems on your own or while studying for interviews.
