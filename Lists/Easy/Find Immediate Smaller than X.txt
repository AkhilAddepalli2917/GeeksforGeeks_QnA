Given an array arr[] of size N containing positive integers and an integer X, find the element in the array which is smaller than X and closest to it.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4 67 13 12 15}
X = 16
Output: 15
Explanation: For a given value 16, there
are four values which are smaller than
it. But 15 is the number which is smaller
and closest to it with minimum difference
of 1.
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1 2 3 4 5}
X = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: No value is smaller than 1.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. You need to complete the given function immediateSmaller() which takes arr, N and X as input parameters and returns the closest element that is smaller than X. If no such element exists, return -1.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= arr[i], X <= 10^4

class Solution:
    def immediateSmaller(self,arr,n,x):
        #return required ans
        
        #code here
        closest = -1
        for num in arr:
            if num < x and (closest == -1 or x - num < x - closest):
                closest = num
        return closest
